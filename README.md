#Error(535-5.7.8) process to solve it 

1.Check Gmail Credentials:
Double-check that the Gmail username (email address) and the password (or app-specific password if two-factor authentication is enabled) in your Nodemailer configuration are correct. Make sure there are no typos or errors in the credentials.

2.App-Specific Password (if Two-Factor Authentication is enabled):
If you have two-factor authentication enabled for your Gmail account, use an app-specific password instead of your regular Gmail password. This is a specific password generated for applications like Nodemailer.

3.Enable "Less Secure App Access":
Check if your Gmail account has "Less secure app access" enabled. You can turn this on in your Google Account settings. However, keep in mind that enabling this option may make your account less secure, so use it with caution.

4.Allow access to your Google Account:
Sometimes, Google may block access from less secure apps. You might need to allow access to your Google Account. Visit the Less secure app access page and turn on "Allow less secure apps."

5.Review Google Account Security Alerts:
Check your Google Account for any security alerts or notifications. Google might block access if it detects suspicious activity.

6.Check for CAPTCHA or Challenge:
Sometimes, Google may present a CAPTCHA challenge if it suspects unusual activity. Ensure that you can log in to your Gmail account through a web browser and complete any CAPTCHA challenges if prompted.

7.Use OAuth2 Authentication:
Consider using OAuth2 authentication instead of providing a username and password directly. This involves additional setup, but it's more secure. Nodemailer supports OAuth2. Refer to the Nodemailer documentation for details on how to set it up.
